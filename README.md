# **TPT Web Scraping**

The task at hand for this project was to scrape data from a website while learning to use Sellenium for the first time. 

The site, Teachers Pay Teachers, is an online platform where educators sell their own created resources for other educators to purchase and use in their classroom.  

Data Retrieved Includes
*   Product Title
*   Seller Store Name
*   Product Price
*   Product Rating
*   Amount of Reviews
*   Product Type
*   Description
*   Learning Standards
